# Headout AI Storefront

A **chat-first meta-catalogue** of the internal AI tools, apps, skills, docs, plugins, MCPs and Zeps built at Headout. The home page IS a single chat front door: describe a task and the concierge finds the existing internal tool that already does it (it routes, it never runs tools). If nothing fits, it points you at how to build (Zeps builder) or request one (Slack). A quiet "+ Add a tool" lets anyone paste a URL and the LLM infers the catalogue metadata.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (binds `PORT`)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/storefront run dev` — run the Vite frontend (binds `PORT`)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages (needs `PORT` + `BASE_PATH`, injected by the platform)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server exec tsx src/lib/seed.ts` — (re)seed ~25 tools with embeddings (idempotent)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres) and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (the user's own OpenAI key). Chat + tool inference call OpenAI directly via `src/lib/openaiClient.ts` (model from `OPENAI_MODEL`, default `gpt-4o`) — **not** the Replit AI integration proxy. Embeddings need no key (local model).

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- Frontend: Vite + React, wouter routing
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + **pgvector** + Drizzle ORM
- Embeddings: local `@huggingface/transformers` (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim) — no API key
- Chat / metadata inference: OpenAI direct with the user's own `OPENAI_API_KEY` (`src/lib/openaiClient.ts`, `OPENAI_MODEL` default `gpt-4o`)
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- Build: esbuild (api-server), Vite (storefront)

## Where things live

- `artifacts/storefront/` — the Vite + React frontend (the product). Routes in `src/App.tsx` (wouter): `/` (home chat), `/registry` (browse), `/tools/:id` (detail); obsolete routes redirect to `/`.
- `artifacts/storefront/src/lib/api.ts` — the only data layer: `fetchTools`/`fetchTool`/`sendChat`/`addToolByUrl`, base `/api` (root-relative; the platform proxy routes it to the API server — no Vite proxy needed). Casts `ApiTool` → `Tool`.
- `artifacts/storefront/src/components/HomeChat.tsx` — the chat front door; `Sidebar.tsx` — read-only nav (Home + Browse catalogue only).
- `artifacts/storefront/src/index.css` — plain-CSS styles. Design tokens + Halyard fonts come from `artifacts/storefront/public/design-system/colors_and_type.css`, linked in `index.html`.
- `lib/db/src/schema/tools.ts` — the `tools` Drizzle table (incl. pgvector `embedding` column), exported via `@workspace/db`.
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/` — `tools.ts` (GET list/get, POST add-by-URL), `chat.ts` (POST chat). `lib/catalogue.ts` (cosine top-K search), `lib/chatAgent.ts` (concierge agent loop), `lib/inferTool.ts` (URL → metadata), `lib/embeddings.ts` (local model), `lib/seed.ts` + `lib/seedData.ts`.
- `.migration-backup/` — the original imported Next.js source, kept as a historical reference (no longer the parity target).

## Architecture decisions

- **Chat-first, not search-first**: the home page is the chat; there is no search box and no three-door (find/build/request) model. The concierge agent does semantic search over the catalogue and routes to tools — it is explicitly a router, never a runner.
- **Postgres + pgvector is the source of truth** for the catalogue (not in-memory mock data, not React context). The old `AppContext` and all `mock*.ts` files were removed.
- **Embeddings run locally** (`@huggingface/transformers`) because neither the OpenAI nor Gemini Replit integrations expose an embeddings endpoint; weights are downloaded once and cached on disk.
- **Read-only browse**: no submit/build/admin/approval/role-switch UI. Obsolete routes (`/submit`, `/build`, `/funnel`, `/requests`, `/admin/*`, etc.) redirect to `/`.
- The client talks to the API with a plain `fetch` to root-relative `/api/...`; the platform proxy forwards to the api-server.

## Product

A single chat front door to find existing internal AI tools (apps, skills, docs, MCPs, plugins, scripts, slack-bots, zeps). On a match it shows inline tool cards that link to read-only detail pages; on no match it offers a Zeps build link and/or a Slack request link. A filterable/searchable read-only registry at `/registry` browses the full catalogue. "+ Add a tool" ingests a pasted URL and infers its metadata via the LLM.

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

- The design-system stylesheet is linked from `index.html` with a **relative** href (`./design-system/...`) so the `@font-face` relative `url()`s and the production base path resolve correctly — do not change it to a root-relative `/design-system/...`.
- Both Vite configs require `PORT` (and the storefront also `BASE_PATH`) at build/dev time — the platform injects these. Running `pnpm run build` bare will fail with "PORT/BASE_PATH environment variable is required"; pass them when building manually.
- `mockup-sandbox` is a scaffold artifact unrelated to this product; its build needs `PORT` and is expected to fail in a bare `pnpm run build` — ignore it.
- The first `/api/chat` (or seed) call after a cold start downloads the local embedding model weights from the HF hub (one-time, cached on disk), so it is noticeably slower than subsequent calls.
